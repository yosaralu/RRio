# install git from internet https://git-scm.com/download/win
# go to Tools --> Global  options --> Git/SVN
# look for the app Git Bash and config git this way:
# git config --global user.name "Sara Colmenares"
# git config --global user.email "quehubosara@gmail.com"
# then type nano (here it does not work) Instead of it, type notepad
# my windows oes not have nano, a program which reads certain kind of text

# now verify you are in the same project go to Tools 
# and select Project Options, then Git/SVN then Git then Yes and Yes 
# (last one yes restart the R session)
# After this it apper an icon git in tool bar and a table Git 
# inside the folder of the project an archive called .gitignore is created


# The Table Git apperas with ? in status so I have to tell Git the files I want to include
# It means to create a repository
# So I go to config in Git tab and call Shell, and type git status
# the red list that appears in shell after type git status shows where the arquives are
# then type: git add . 
# then type: git commit -m "" 
# -m means a message is comming and "" is where the message is
# so type: git commit -m "my first message" 
# when I save data, in whatever the files, Git table will show it, 
# no more quotation marks will appear, now appear an M in status instead of the ?
# in shell type: git status 
# Everytime I do changes I have to make a comment to save a new file back up
# In R: Save first
# Then I go to Commit and make a comment to decide what is going to be saved in the backup
# If I do not commit, the changes I do will never be saved in the back up
# After save the commit I can go to History to see all the versions
